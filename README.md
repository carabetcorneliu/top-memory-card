# Memory Card Project of T-O-P

This is my incipient version of the Memory Card Project in the React Course of The Odin Project Curriculum.
The game has Moldovan Traditional food cards, randomly decked after each pick.
The goal of the game is to select those foods that you have tried, and not select the same food twice in a game.
